# Frontend Mentor - Recipe page

## The challenge

Your challenge was to build out this recipe page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. 

## The Solution

- The example here was built using a mix of flex and grid, with a mobile-first design.

- Sizing challenges with the H1 element on smaller screens were addressed by clamping the font size, providing it with min and max elements and the ability to scale in between.

- As an enhancement to the original design, grid template areas have been used to allow the user to switch between portrait and landscape displays (achieved using Javascript)

- The landscape button only appears if the page is wide enough to support landscape view. If the page shrinks too narrow, landscape mode is disabled and the button is hidden.
